<h1>Photojournalism</h1>

<p>     Photojournalism is the process of story telling using the medium of photography as your main story telling device. While a journalist will use their pen and paper to tell stories, a photojournalist will use their camera to capture the visual representation of a story.</p>

<p>Most of us are familiar with the old adage “a picture is worth a thousand words”. Well this is the theory behind photojournalism. News publications are willing to pay top dollar to those photojournalists who can capture the most dramatic images on film or their CCD chip.</p>

<p>Robert Capa is a great example of a photojournalist. He photographed many wars and had the motto “If your pictures aren’t good enough you’re not close enough”. Unfortunately this motto lead to his death as he was fatally injured in the Indochina War.</p>

<p>His work, along with many other photojournalists have educated millions of people on various social injustices that happen around the world. If you are interested in becoming a photojournalist then you might want to consider enrolling in our photography school.</p>

<p>We will teach you all of the important concepts behind photographic composition and both technical and artistic considerations.</div>
