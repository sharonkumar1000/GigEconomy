      <h1>   What is portrait photography?</h1>
<p>    Portrait photography is about capturing the essence, personality, identity and attitude of a person utilizing backgrounds, lighting and posing.</p>

<p>While this definition may sound simple, portrait photography can be one of the most challenging forms of photography to master. The goal is to capture a photo that appears both natural and prepared to allow the subject’s personality to show through.</p>

<p>As long as the portrait photographer can effectively capture the subject’s character, the equipment he/she uses does not really matter. While it always helps to have equipment that is state of the art, it is really not needed.</p>

<h1>   What does a portrait photographer do?</h1>
<p>   The portrait photographer is responsible for taking pictures of their subject(s). Portrait photographers find the best background/location with the correct lighting for their portrait photographs. Most portrait photographers also provide their subjects with posing tips. They also edit and print the photos to give to their clients.</p></div>
